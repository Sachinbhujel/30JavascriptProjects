The five-day festival typically takes place in October or November and signifies the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.", "Diwali celebrations include lighting oil lamps called diyas, setting off firecrackers, decorating homes with colorful rangoli art patterns, partaking in family feasts, sharing mithai sweets, and praying to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity.", "On the night of Diwali, homes are brightly lit to welcome Lakshmi and people wear their finest clothes and exchange gifts with loved ones.", " For many, Diwali honors the return of Lord Rama and Sita to Ayodhya after their 14-year exile as told in the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana.", "The festival inspires reflection on the inner light that protects people from spiritual darkness.
